mindstorms
==========

This is a repository where I've gathered code from my experiments with Lego
Mindstorms. Here's what I ultimately wanted to achieve:

1. ~~User visits a webpage,
2. The webpage contains video from a robot (streamed from an Android IP Webcam),
3. Webpage allows the user to control the robot using~~:

- [x] keyboard,
- [ ] mouse,
- [ ] touchscreen,
- [ ] gamepad,
- [ ] telepathy.

4. Embedded video shows information about:

- [ ] smartphone camera battery state {partially done},
- [ ] robot battery state,
- [ ] state of the motors,
- [ ] other smartphone camera sensors (accelerometer? gps? light sensor? temperature?)

5. It is possible to also control:

- [ ] smartphone camera used (front/back) {partially done},
- [ ] smartphone LED {partially done},
- [ ] weather.

6. There is a simulator attached that allows the developer to work on the
project without having the robot available {WIP}.
